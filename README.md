# Pearto attack 
# ---> random image loop

This Python script is a simple random image viewer. Upon execution, it will randomly pick and display an image from the "data" folder located in the same directory as the script. The program opens a new image every 0.5 seconds in an endless loop.

The images are selected randomly, ensuring a fresh experience each time the program runs. The script continues to display new images until it is manually stopped by the user.

This program can be used to quickly and randomly browse through a collection of images without needing to manually open each file.

Features:
 - Random Image Selection: Displays a random image every 0.5 seconds.

 - Simple and Dynamic: Automatically updates the displayed image in a loop.

 - Manual Exit: Stops when the user closes the terminal or stops the script in the IDE.



To do :
 - ~~make a background music when program is running~~
   
 - more image
   
 - ~~automatically write "teto supremacy" in a loop~~

 - make it runnable with a .exe
