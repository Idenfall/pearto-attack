# Pearto attack 
# ---> random image loop

This Python script is a simple random image viewer. Upon execution, it will randomly pick and display an image from the "data" folder located in the same directory as the script. The program opens a new image every 0.5 seconds in an endless loop.

The images are selected randomly, ensuring a fresh experience each time the program runs. The script continues to display new images until it is manually stopped by the user.

This program can be used to quickly and randomly browse through a collection of images without needing to manually open each file.

Features:

 - Displays random images from a specified folder (data).

 - Simple and Dynamic: Automatically updates the displayed image in a loop.

 - Plays an MP3 file (named teto.mp3) in the background in a continuous loop (te- te- te- teto teto kasane teto).

 - 1h of beatiful music

 - auto tipping "teto supremacy"

 - Designed to be disruptive for fun, but can be frustrating if left uncontrolled.

To do :
 - ~~make a background music when program is running~~
   
 - more image
   
 - ~~automatically write "teto supremacy" in a loop~~

 - make it runnable with a .exe
